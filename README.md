# Vivi - The University Cat Bot üê±


## Description
Vivi is a friendly Discord bot that embodies the playful and charming spirit of our university through the persona of an adorable cat. Named after our university's mascot, Vivi aims to bring joy, engagement, and useful functionalities to our Discord community.

Vivi leverages the "emoberta-large" Sentiment Analysis model from the Hugging Face library through the Inference API to understand and respond to sentiments expressed by users.
